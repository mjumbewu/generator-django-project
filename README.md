# generator-django-project

A starter for a Django app as I like to build 'em these days.

(*Note: I'm learning how to put together a generator as I go along; borrowing a lot from https://github.com/diegotoral/generator-django*)


## Installation & Usage

First, you'll have to have npm installed. When you do, run:

    $ npm install yo
    $ npm install git+https://github.com/mjumbewu/generator-django-project.git
    $ yo django-project

And follow the prompts.
